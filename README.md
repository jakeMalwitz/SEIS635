Concentration

Rules

Using two standard 52 card decks, remove the jokers, then shuffle each deck thoroughly. Organize the cards into eight rows of 13 cards. This will be referred to as the pool. Determine which player goes first via best two out of three rock, paper, scissors. The first player chooses two cards and flips them face up. If the turned up cards are of the same rank, suite, and color, the player wins, removing the cards from the pool and placing them in a pile. The player then resumes their turn. If the cards do not match in either suite, rank, or color, the second player begins their turn following the same pattern. Once all the cards are removed from the pool, the player with the most number of matched pairs wins.
